# Changelog

All notable changes to the Synology MCP Server are documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- `DirectApiClient` — lightweight HTTP client for raw SYNO.* API calls with session management and 30s response caching
- `discover_apis` — list all available API endpoints on a NAS
- `get_disk_details` — full disk hardware info (model, serial, vendor, firmware, role, tray status)
- `get_ssd_cache` — SSD cache pool status and member disk health
- `get_storage_pool_members` — per-pool disk membership with RAID details
- `get_nfs_exports` — NFS shared folders with allowed hosts and permissions
- `get_services_status` — running state of NFS, SMB, SSH, rsync, SNMP
- `get_ups_status` — UPS model, battery charge, runtime, NUT config
- `get_hardware_info` — fan speeds, power recovery, beep control
- `get_recent_logs` — system logs with severity/keyword filtering
- `get_notifications` — DSM notification config and alert history
- `get_active_connections` — connected SMB/NFS/FTP clients
- `get_users` — local user accounts and group membership
- `get_update_status` — available DSM updates and current version

### Changed
- `get_health_summary` — enhanced with SSD cache, UPS, and NFS service alerts via direct API
- Tool count: 10 → 23 (health tier)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- Added `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` to Dockerfile so NAS connection logs are visible in `docker compose logs`

### Changed
- Renamed `mcp-readonly` to `mcp-service` in README and `.env.example` — the server supports write tier, so the old name was misleading

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- Initial release
- FastMCP server with native Streamable HTTP transport (port 8485)
- Multi-NAS support via `SYNOLOGY_<NAME>_HOST` environment variable discovery
- Three permission tiers controlled by `MCP_PERMISSION_TIER` env var:
  - `health` (default): 10 tools — system info, volumes, disks, SMART, shares, network, utilization, health summary
  - `read`: health + 3 tools — list directory, get file info, list shared folders
  - `write`: health + read + 2 tools — upload file, delete file
- Docker image published to GHCR (`ghcr.io/lefty3382/synology-mcp`)
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated Docker image builds on tag push
